<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a troubleshooting guide for \____'s email signatures

It should be noted that images dont't play well with email signatures as different email clients handle images differently.
As such the following questions should be noted when designing your email signature.

* What email client do you use
* Who are the majority recipients and what email client do thy use
* Do you really need all those images??

Define the purpose of an email campaign: it might be more efficient and safe to enclose an image as a separate file.


## Installing your email signture
As many email clients like Outlook 2010 and gmail, don't support HTML file import, the only way to add setup an signature is
through the client's given tools or copying and pasting a prerender email signature

* Open your [name].html file with your favourite internet browser.
* Copy the email signature (ctrl+A,  ctrl+C). 
* Go to your mailbox settings & paste the generated signature.
  * Open Outlook 2010 and go to `File > Option > Mail > Signature`

> **NB**: if signature is not aligned then repeat the process.

### alterntive solutions
#### Office 365 / outlook.live.com
* This is a bit more hands/technical aproach. See [this issue](https://github.com/danmindru/responsive-html-email-signature/issues/52).
